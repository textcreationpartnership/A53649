            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>AS the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Princes, upon the News of any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner's Arrival, are wont to expect ſome Curioſities of the Place from whence he came, to prepare the way for his Reception,
<pb facs="tcp:43688:4"/>
and Introduce the Stranger into their Preſence; ſo, in imitation of this reſpectful Cuſtom, this Foreign Voyage hopes for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to your Favour and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, upon that Stock of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty which it preſumes upon; and which it brings with it as well from <hi>Africa,</hi> as ſeveral remoter Parts and Kingdoms of the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> For in thoſe Places, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Things here taken notice of, which have eſcap'd the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of other Travellers. I need not mention, my Lord, with what facility you can employ your Judgment, to penetrate into all that is any where uſeful, whilſt your vigorous Fancy can as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſent to you all that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertive in its Entertainment. And tho' I confeſs I have very great Reaſon to dread the ſtrictneſs of
<pb facs="tcp:43688:4"/>
your Cenſure, upon the ſtrength of your admirable Endowments; yet methinks I find a relief to this Fear, in that Native Candor, which ſo eaſily tempers the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy of your Thoughts with favourable Conſtructions.</p>
                  <p>But I will not tranſgreſs thoſe Meaſures of Civility, of which your <hi>EXCELLENCY</hi> is ſo abſolute a Maſter, by being too tedious in this Addreſs; nor there- violate thoſe Decencies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, which your Practice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends ſo fully to the World, and of which none have had more ſenſible Demonſtration than my ſelf: Eſpecially conſidering how much is due to you from the Sacred Order, which you treat with that conſtant uncommon Civility, as if you deſign'd to ballance that Contempt, which is
<pb facs="tcp:43688:5"/>
too apt to be caſt upon it: Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, as in other Perfections, ſo in this too, the Ancient Poets, who inſtructed Men in Reverencing not only the Gods, but in a due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſuch as were their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Servants; and in all things maintaining ſtill that Greatneſs by your Munificence, which you freely part with in your Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions. I need not determine, with how much Reaſon the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Subjects aſcribe this Character to their Emperours, <hi>That their Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Condition is owing to their Merits, and that they as far tranſcend other Mortals in thoſe, as they do in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> but I am ſatisfied, 'tis the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Loyalty, Prudence, Greatneſs of Mind, and other Virtues, which have juſtly rais'd you to that Sphere, wherein you move, kindly influencing the

the Throne, and had been receiv'd with the Univerſal Joy of all the Nation. In all places where we came, we were welcomed with loud and chearful Acclamations, and were entertain'd with unuſual Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Reſpect, as happy Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of as grateful News, as ever arrived in thoſe Parts.

                     <p>We had not long left the Lands-End of <hi>England,</hi> before we eſpied a great Fleet of Ships, which appear'd to us at a diſtance like a floating Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and ſeiz'd us with no little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation.

Our Commander therefore having got without Gun-ſhot of their Citadels, Mann'd out his Pinnace with twelve or fourteen Hands, well provided with Swords and Fire-Arms, and appointed them to Row along the Shoar, to apprehend, if poſſible, ſome few of their Fiſhers, to ſupply the places of our Sailers.

To deprive Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Subjects, and Maſters of their Servants, under a pretence of making them better Chriſtians, is in my Opinion to make them worſe.

This ſtartled the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants on ſhore, and awaken'd their Care of contriving ſome means for their Safety; for they perceiv'd the inraged Multitude, who ſtood upon the Strand, would not be pacify'd without them.

inexorable, and ſeriouſly reſolv'd upon what he writ, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants brought along with them Money for a Voyage, after they had prevail'd to get on Board. For they durſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without their Prieſts; and they knew not where the Voyage would end. After their difficult Paſſage on Board, they related the Confuſion the Place was in, and how tumultuous the People had ſuddenly grown, upon the account of the Detention of their Prieſts; and how they were upon the Bank of the Sea, repeating their Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, <hi>Our Padres!

The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, who heard all this, and refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting upon the extreme Inconvenience attending the Engliſh upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43688:26"/>
reſolved to ſend them all on Shore, to remove that Diſturbance which he ſaw was otherwiſe unavoidable; for he thought the Prieſts would be as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to him at Sea, as they commonly are at Land, and a Burthen to either Element;<note place="margin">The Prieſts diſmiſs'd.</note> and ſo diſmiſs'd them all to their great Satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>After this we ſtood off from Shore, fill'd our Sails, and without any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Adieu, either to the Governour or the Fort, we left the Iſland.

ſight at firſt moved us to condole the ſad Object, till we were inform'd of the execrable Villanies which brought him to this lamentable and painful end, and made us applaud the Juſtice of thoſe who were the Executioners of this Vengeance upon him. For no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity was able to match thoſe Crimes wherein he had been a long and skilful Practitioner; even this Deſtiny, tho' ſo horrid and ſevere, will yet be thought Indulgence, and an Act of Clemency. This Miſcreant being poſſeſs'd with a Spirit of Cruelty, and actuacted by Malice, had ſucceſsfully contriv'd the Death of near twenty Perſons about this place, by mixing a deadly Poyſon with the Palm Wine, which he ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably offer'd for the refreſhment of their parched Palates. This deadly Liquor was not ſubject to any ſuſpicion of being mortal, becauſe the Juice of the Palm, with which it was intermixt, was a Liquor ſo common and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and their beſt and moſt pleaſing Drink. The King therefore, upon the Information of this Fellow's treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſpatching of his Subjects by ſuch poyſonous Draughts, immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed

The News of which made him ſeek a Refuge among the Deſarts and the moſt inhabitable parts of the Country; but the purſuit after him was ſo vigorous, that no Thickets could ſhelter or ſecure him, the whole Country hotly purſued him, and chaſed him as a common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, till at length he fell a Victim to their juſt Rage upon this Shore; where his noiſom Carcaſe, being under an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict of being Interr'd (the ordinary manner of burying among them) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as loathſom and offenſive as his Life had been, and was left a Prey to the Savages of the Wilderneſs, and the wild Beaſts of the Field. The unuſual manner of tormenting this Malefactor, by expoſing his Body to the Inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Weather, and the Beaſts of Prey, was wiſely deſign'd by the King as a Terror to ſuch abominable flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Practices, and to retain the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their Duty.</p>

                     <p>Since the Conqueſt of <hi>Viziapour,</hi> the Diamond Mines are claim'd and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd by the <hi>Indian</hi> Emperour, who for ſome time ſince thought fit to ſhut them up.<note place="margin">The Rate of digging for Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</note> They formerly paid to the King of <hi>Golconda</hi> ſo much hourly for the liberty of digging, whether they were fortunate in finding any Diamond or no; a Pagod, which is a piece of Gold valued there at Nine Shillings, was the ſtated Price for an Hours time. We have an Account, that he reſerv'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diamond Ground in his Country for his own Uſe, which yielded him
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43688:111"/>
daily ſeveral Ounces, whenever he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his Labourers to work, which were reckon'd to be near Six Thouſand, whoſe very Wages conſum'd a great part of the Gains.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that dig the Ground are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly look'd to,<note place="margin">All Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds of ſuch a ſize belong to the <hi>Mogul.</hi>

By this means we ſometimes meet with large Stones very valuable. Two I ſaw at <hi>Suratt,</hi> the ſmaller was a ſort of Table-Diamond, rated at Twelve Thouſand Pounds; the other was lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and exceeded the Price of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther almoſt Eight Thouſand Pounds. All Stones of ſuch a Size are Royalties, and Sacred to the Crown; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever finds them, or whereſoever they are heard of, they are preſently ſeized, and taken for the uſe of the <hi>Mogul.</hi> Therefore the Owner of theſe Noble Diamonds ſolemnly engaged our Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and bound us to Silence, before we were permitted a ſight of them. The
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43688:112"/>
Stones of <hi>India</hi> are not ſo rich, or of equal Repute with thoſe of the Iſland <hi>Borneo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Diamonds from <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> moſt fam'd.</note> whoſe Sparkling and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs gives a glorious and ſurpaſſing Splendour. The Diamonds are found rough, cover'd with a Coat or Shell, which is taken off, and then the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond is poliſh'd, and cut in ſuch Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, as the natural Shape of the Stone, or the Deſign of the Lapidary inclines to.<note place="margin">The way to know true Diamonds.</note> The Art of diſcerning the excellence of Diamonds by the Eye, is very curious; becauſe there is ſuch an Affinity between the Brightneſs of Stones, that ſome eminent <hi>Indian</hi> Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellers have been impos'd upon by falſe ones brought from <hi>Europe;</hi> becauſe they ſhot ſuch Rays, and the Luſtre with which they ſhin'd was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. But the Hammer and Scales diſcover'd that Fallacy, which the Eyes could not; they were ſofter than a genuine Diamond, and lighter than one of the ſame ſize: For no Stone comes near a Diamond in hardneſs; nor, of the ſame magnitude, in Weight. Diamonds take their Eſtimate from their Magnitude,<note place="margin">The valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds.</note> Splendour, Figure, and Water; for ſome Perſons value a

Diamond of ſuch a Water much more than of another; and ſome are pleas'd with ſuch a ſort of Cut, beyond any elſe. Thus a fair Roſe-Diamond of Black Water and Diamond Cut was of general Eſteem with ſome <hi>Europeans</hi> at <hi>Suratt,</hi> whilſt a White Water gain'd a Repute with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and Table-Diamonds were with them of beſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem. The <hi>Moors</hi> exalt the Rate of ſuch a Diamond, whoſe Surface is cut in very minute Figures, much leſs than what the <hi>Europeans</hi> affect, though in all things elſe the Diamond was equally good and valuable. For as the uſe of a Diamond, and all other Stones, is very inconſiderable, in reſpect of that high Value which the Fancy of Man and common Cuſtom has put upon them; ſo are their Rates too very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable and uncertain, as this Inſtance of a Rubie will make out. A Rubie,<note place="margin">The Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a Rubie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond.</note> which in Perfection is a Stone ſuperiour to a Diamond, made this gradual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of its Rates in <hi>India.</hi> It was ſold at firſt at the rate of 400 Roupies,<note place="margin">Several prices paid for the ſame Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie.</note> afterwards at 600, then at 800, then at 1200; from this it roſe to 1600, thence to 2000, after this it mounted
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43688:113"/>
to 2400, then to 2800, from which it was ſold for 3000, and lately for 3200. Thus the Fancy of the Purchaſer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd it at length Seven Hundred <hi>per Cent.</hi> beyond the Original Price it was firſt reckon'd at.

She freely imparts her lewd Intentions, earneſtly requeſts her Fidelity, and withal deſires ſhe would vouchſafe to take the Meſſage upon her ſelf, and walk into the Bazar, and there eſpy what comely Perſon ſhe could meet with, proper, lovely, young, and handſom, and conduct him privately to ſuch Apartments as ſhe had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43688:117"/>
The Friend, thus inſtructed, goes abroad, views, and culls out from the reſt in the Bazar the moſt amiable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe could meet with, and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſtep aſide, diſcovers the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triegue, and then conducts him to the place appointed. The Gallant it ſeems was Husband to the Gentlewoman that expected him, who ſeeing him come near the Gate, was all in Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and quite confounded at the ſight of his unfortunate Approach. But ſhe found it was no time to dally, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay her Reſolutions, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſummon'd all her Thoughts, and after a little Pauſe, threw her ſelf directly upon the Cot or Bed that was by, and put the Covering over her Face. Her Husband, ignorant whom ſhe was, and knowing for what Intent he was ſent for, begins immediately to diſturb her, and by and by endeavours to uncover her Face. At which ſhe roſe up in a ſeeming Rage, and told him, <hi>For ſhame, Sir, I have often heard of your Pranks and looſe Intriegues abroad, but my Charity made me willing to unbelieve it, till this Minute has given me an invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for aſſuring me of the Truth of what

Can you pretend to ſo much Tenderneſs and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for me, and yet liſten to the leaſt Temptation that courts or calls you from me?

After this they carry one or two of theſe Falcons into the Fields, and flying one of them at an Antilope, it faſtens juſt upon his Noſe, which ſo blinds and ſtops the Antilope, by the force and fluttering of its Wings, that he can neither well eſpy his way, nor find his Feet as nimbly as he would; and this gives a very eaſie admittance to the Men or Dogs to come in and catch him.

Preſent for the chief Miniſters, and it was very rarely to be found, however he brought with him a Taſte of it for our Preſident, among ſeveral other kinds, wherein he gave him a Morning En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. And a Learned Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who for ſome Years had lived in <hi>China,</hi> ſpoke nothing of this Flower of Tea, only gave this Account of three other ſorts that grew there,<note place="margin">Three ſorts of Tea.</note> and were moſt frequently drunk among them, <hi>viz.</hi> Bing, Singlo, and Bohe.

Before the Rains fall, the Air is extreme dry and parching, and when they are fallen, ſuch ſtore of hot unwholſome vapours are rais'd and ſcatter'd in the Air, that they give Birth to more Diſeaſes, than all the Year beſides produces.

to the number of 300 a Day.

The Thoughts of it haſten'd them back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain towards the Cuſtom-Houſe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire if there were any <hi>Engliſh</hi> News; and upon their Return were ſurpriz'd at the ſight of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Boat, which they eſpyed was rowing up the River; and were no ſooner arrived at the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-Houſe, but they found the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man who had been expected in her. The News of this was very grateful to the Preſident, and not ungrateful to
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:43688:190"/>
the <hi>Bramin,</hi> who received a curious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramin from the Hands of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whom he had oblig'd with ſo faithful and particular a Prophetick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p>And the worthy Preſident Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> who had himſelf been ſometimes in diſtreſs for <hi>Engliſh</hi> News, has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe told me of a <hi>Bramin</hi>'s Propoſals to him, of bringing him undoubted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, how the Companies Affairs in <hi>England</hi> ſtood, within the ſpace of four days.

ſo that if their Houſes were on Fire, they would ſooner be perſuaded to pour on Oyl to increaſe, than Water to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage the Flame.

And a <hi>Perſy</hi> Servant, who is commanded to bring a hot Steel, and warm with it a Bowl of Punch, will plead his Excuſe, and that he dare not haſten the coolneſs of the Steel by a violent abatement of the Heat. The active Flame muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to live, whilſt there's any Fuel for it to feed on; if the Fire is once kindled, all care is taken that it comes to a natural Expiration, and no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence allow'd to bring it to a period ſooner. Another account we have for their reſpect for Fire, is, that their great Law-giver <hi>Zertooſt,</hi> was taken into Heaven, and brought from thence Fire with him (<hi>Prometheus</hi> like) which he commanded his Followers after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to Worſhip.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall not mention their Marriages, which much reſemble the manner of the <hi>Bannians,</hi> but proceed only to a Deſcription of their way of Burying, which is this.<note place="margin">Their dead Bodies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Birds of Prey.</note> The nobleſt Sepulture which they fancy they can beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their deceaſed Friends, is expoſing them to be devour'd by the Fowls of the Air, and beſtowing their Carcaſſes on the Birds of Prey.<note place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony uſed by the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> in their Burials.</note> After the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is for ſome time dead, the <hi>Halal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors</hi> (which area ſort of ſordid <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) take and carry it out upon a Bier into the open Fields, near the place where it is expos'd to the Fowls of Heaven. When 'tis there decently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited upon the Ground, a particular Friend bears the Fields and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Villages, upon the hunt for a Dog, 'till he can find one out; and having had the good luck to meet him, he cheriſhes and intices him with a Cake of Bread, which he carries in his Hand for that purpoſe, 'till he draws him as near the Corps as he is able; for
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:43688:201"/>
the nearer the Dog is brought to the dead Body, the nearer are its approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to Felicity. And if the hungry Cur can by bits of Cake be brought ſo nigh the Deceaſed, as to come up to him, and take a piece cut of his Mouth, 'tis then an unqueſtionable Sign, that the Condition he died in was very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; but if the timorous Dog ſtartles at the ſight, or loaths the Object, or being lately well fed, has no Stomach to that ordinary Morſel, which he muſt ſnatch out of the dead Man's Jaws, the Caſe then with him is deſperate, and his ſtate deplorable. The poor Man whom I ſaw, was by theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticks, very miſerable; for the ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Cur would by no means be inticed to any diſtance near him. When the Dog has finiſht his part of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, two <hi>Daroos,</hi> at a Furlong's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Bier, ſtand up with joined Hands, and loudly repeat for near half an hour, a tedious Form of Prayer by Heart; but with ſuch a quick diſpatch, that they ſcarce drew Breath all the while, as if they had been under ſome invincible neceſſity of running over the Words in ſuch a time.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:43688:202"/>
All the while they were thus gabling, a piece of White Paper faſten'd to each Ear, o'rethwart the Face, hung down two or three Inches below the Chin; and as ſoon as they had ended their Petitions, the <hi>Halalchors</hi> took up the Corps, and conveyed it to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory, which was near; all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ranking themſelves by two and two, and following it with joined Hands. The place of Sepulture is in the open Fields, within a Wall built in form of a Circle, about twelve Foot high, and about an hundred in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference; in the middle of which was a Door of Stone about ſix foot from the ground, which was open'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Corps. The Ground within the Walls is rais'd above four Foot, and made ſhelving towards the Corner, that the Filth and Moiſture which are drain'd continually from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes, may by an eaſie paſſage deſcend into a Sink made in the middle to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. The Corps therefore was left here, and all the Company depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence, betook themſelves to a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volet that run near the place for Ablu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to cleanſe themſelves from what
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:43688:202"/>
defilements, on this Melancholy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they might have contracted; and retir'd afterwards to their proper Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the City, from whence this place is diſtant about a Mile. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of a Day or two after, ſome of the neareſt Relatives return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain hither, to obſerve which of the Eyes of their deceaſed Friend was firſt pickt out by the hungry Vultures; and if they find that the right Eye was firſt ſeis'd on, this abodes undoubted Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; if the left, they then are ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for that's a direful ſign of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Perſies</hi> are very nice in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Hair,<note place="margin">The Burying of their Hair every Year.</note> and careful to preſerve whatever is cut off their Heads or Beards, that nothing of it be loſt or careleſly thrown about, but once a Year be decently laid in their Burying place.

                     <p>The Burying-place of the <hi>Perſies</hi> is an Object the moſt dreadful,<note place="margin">The <hi>Perſies</hi> horrid Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-place.</note> and of the moſt horrid Proſpect in the World, and much more frightful than a Field of Slaughter'd Men.

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:43688:203"/>
of Carcaſſes of very different diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Colours and Aſpects. Some are ſeen there bleeding freſh, but ſo torn by the Vultures that croud upon the Walls, that their Faces reſemble that of a Death's Head, with the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls out, and all the Fleſh upon the Cheeks pickt off. And on the Fleſhy part of the Body, where the Ravenous Bird taſted a more delicious Morſel, are eaten ſeveral large Holes, and all the Skin on every part is mangled, and torn by the ſharp Beaks of theſe devouring Creatures. Here was a Leg, and there an Arm, here lay half, and there the quarter of a Man, Some look'd as if they were partly Jelly, others were harden'd like Tann'd Leather, by the various operations of the Sun and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon them: Here lay one pickt as clean as a Skeleton, near that, another with the Skin in ſome parts Green, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Yellow, and the whole ſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, as if all within were Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. A ſight terrible enough almoſt to afright an hungry Vulture from his Prey. But theſe Birds are moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with theſe diſmal Objects, and that noiſom ſmell which evaporates
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:43688:203"/>
from the dead Corps affords a pleaſant Odour to their Senſes. The ſtench of the Bodies is intolerable, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity ſufficient to ſtrike any Man dead that would endure it; and yet the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures chuſe to fit to the Leeward upon the Wall, luxuriouſly to ſuck up and indulge their ſmell with theſe deadly foul Vapours. Some of theſe glutted Birds were ſo cloy'd and cramm'd with Humane Fleſh, that they ſeem'd ſcarce able to take Wing, and the Feathers of others were much moulted away, by this kind of rank feeding.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this manner of Burying, in uſe with the <hi>Perſies,</hi> near <hi>Suratt,</hi> there are other Eaſtern Nations who have peculiarly affected the Intombing their dead Bodies in Animals.

                        <note place="margin">The Food of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note>The Inhabitants of <hi>Muſcatt</hi> feed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly upon either Fiſh or Fleſh; they eat Beef, Mutton, Goat and Deer, and the Fleſh of Camels is admir'd by them, and is in repute for a Healthful ſort of Meat. But they are very nice and curious in killing thoſe Animals on which they feed, and which they refuſe to taſte 'till the Meat is cleans'd and waſht from the Blood. They abound too in many ſorts of Fiſh, and are ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in Eating of ſome kinds of them, ſuch eſpecially as have no Scales, from

And will not allow any Boat to go, or come aſhore, or to row from Ship to Ship, either before the Sun riſes, or after it is down; to the end that all that Traffick may do their Buſineſs while it is Day, that no man might diſpoſe of his Goods ſecretly, and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf by the obſcurity of the Night.</p>

                     <p>When the forementioned Captain <hi>Say</hi> had unluckily loſt his Ship on the Iſland of <hi>Macira,</hi>

The ſight of this deplorable Accident mov'd the <hi>Arabs</hi> to Pity and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards them, and made them offer their Service, by ſuch Signs, as they thought might be moſt Intelligible, for aſſiſting them in the Recovery of thoſe Goods that were on board the WracK. They were perfect ſtrangers both of them to each others Perſons and Language, and therefore one among the reſt, who lookt like the Governour, rais'd a heap of Sand, as they ſat near one another, upon the Shoar, which he divided into three parts, reſerving two to himſelf, and offering the other to the Captain. But the Captain eſteeming it unequally proportion'd, ſhook his Head, in token that he diſlik'd the Bargain. The Governour ſeeing this, adjuſted the matter with more equality,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:43688:230"/>
and divided the Heap of Sand into two parts only, one of which he took to himſelf, and gave the other half to the Captain; which becauſe he thought it very fair, they ſhook Hands upon it, as a ſign they were both well content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Money which was brought on Shoar, and ſaved from the Wrack, was twelve or fourteen Thouſand Pounds, which they contriv'd to divide in this manner. They tyed to a Stick two Baskets inſtead of a pair of Scales, and made them as equipoize as they could, and by theſe they weighed each parcel that was brought off from the Ship with great exactneſs; if there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd any ſeeming advantage in either Ballance, the Governour forc'd that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon the Captain, ſo that he was not injur'd one Mite, nor in all that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count loſt a Farthing that was his Due. If the Inhabitants upon all the Coaſts of <hi>Europe</hi> were as Hoſpitable and Juſt to all Perſons of their own Perſwaſion, as theſe <hi>Arabians</hi> were to thoſe of a ſtrange Faith, and diſtant Nation, thoſe that do narrowly eſcape with their Lives from the Dangers of the Sea, would not ſo often by a mercileſs People be

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:43688:232"/>
been ſome time at Sea they parted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and the Ship wherein the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had imbarked, eſpyed a little after, two Sail to windward of them, as far as they could ſee from the top-Maſt-Head, which made all the Sail they could after them, and thereby forc'd them to bear away right before the Wind with all the Sail they had; and to lighten their Ship ſo as that ſhe might the better eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape them, they cut away their Boat which was tow'd a ſtern, and threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of valuable Goods over-board. But the two Ships notwithſtanding this, outſaild them, and as they came up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, the Black Sea-men deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by their Colours, to be <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganians.</hi> They gave the Captain Chaſe all the Day long 'till four a Clock in the Afternoon, who fir'd the Stern-Chaſe with his four Guns all the while; at length they ſhot his Man at the Helm thro' the Head, and laid him on board in the Midſhips, entring 70 or 80 Men with Sword and Target. The Black Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who were thirty, leapt over-board to ſave their Lives, leaving the Ship to the Captain and his two Servants. The Throat of one of them was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:43688:233"/>
cut, and as they came in fury to hew down the Captain, and ſlay him inſtantly, as they had done his Servant, he fended off the fatal Blow by receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on his Hand, which was cut half off thro' the dint and violence of the Stroke. While they were thus eager for his Deſtruction, and intent in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his Life, they eſpyed a Rich Prize which diverted their Fury and Deſign; for the Captain wore a ſett of Gold Buttons upon his Coat, which they preſently flew at upon the firſt ſight, and were ſo zealous for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, that he ranſom'd his Life by the price of his Gold. They ſtript him as naked as an <hi>Indian Faquir,</hi> excepting only a ſmall piece of a ſhirt to cover his Nakedneſs, and left him in that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone-like Condition for two Months, without either Hat to his Head, or Shoe to his Foot. One of the <hi>Sanganian</hi> Ships which had made them a Prize, was of ſome Force, ſhe carried ten Guns and 150 Men; the other was only a ſmall Galley of no more than four Guns and 50 Men, whereby the Captain who had reſiſted them ſtoutly for ſome time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily overpower'd, was forc'd to
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:43688:233"/>
ſurrender. The <hi>Sanganians</hi> after the Diſpute wat over, finding no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, grew compaſſionate and kind, and refreſht the Captain with Water and Opium,<note place="margin">Opium a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which was the Nouriſhment they found moſt proper for themſelves after any hard Labour or Languiſhment of Spirit, and the ſpeedieſt Relief for decayed Nature. They were much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd too for the Cure of his Hand, which was in danger of being loſt by the deepneſs of the Wound, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to it Loaf Sugar to ſtop the Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſomething elſe to keep the Wound clean; after which the Wool of a Sheep's Back, and the Oil of their Lamps, without any other Medicines, in a ſhort time thoroughly perfected the Cure.</p>
                     <p>The Ship was taken near the Iſland of <hi>Bombay,</hi> which made them ſpend a Month in Sailing before they Arriv'd in their own Country. When they drew near <hi>Aramra,</hi> which was the Port to which they deſign'd, they according to Cuſtom, fir'd a Gun belonging to the Captain's Ship, to ſalute their Country and Relations; in which the Captain had hid 1500 Venetians, to ſecure them

from the Rapine of the <hi>Pyrates,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſafe in that ſtrong Hold, but were by this means unluckily loſt; which made it a very coſtly Salute to our poor Commander, of whoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they diſcharg'd near 700 <abbr>

                     <p>The Queen of the Country, after ſhe heard of their Arrival, ſent a Meſſenger for the Captain to bring him up to Court, whither he travell'd for two or three Miles without Covering either to his Head or Feet, very ill equipt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Preſence of a Queen. When he came in this diſtreſs before her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, ſhe ſpoke to him by a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Interpreter, who inquir'd of him by the Queen's directions, which of her People they were that had his Moneys; which he anſwer'd he could not tell. Then ſhe threatned to keep him a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Exile from his Country, and for his further Comfort, would allow him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Salt Water to drink.</p>
                     <p>It happen'd about a Month before this time, that a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ship with a Prieſt and his Images had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and brought into this Harbour, which becauſe they were devoutly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd

For being robb'd of all his Wealth, but an hundred Checkins which were privately hid in ſome part of the Ship, his Cook came to him and acquainted him, that the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain of the Man of War, who was put in Commander in chief on Board them, would ingage to return him half of whatever Money was committed to his Cuſtody. The Captain deliver'd to him an hundred pieces of Gold, which the Boatſwain tied in a ſmall bit of Cloath, with a ſmall Line to it and a Bouy at the end of it, and threw it over-board. For every Man was ſearched before they went aſhoar, and not ſuffer'd to come from aboard, 'till

and different Conjectures; for Antiquity (we find) did not confine the Name of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> only to that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now Channel which divides <hi>Arabia</hi> from <hi>Africk,</hi> and gives a boundary to ſome parts of thoſe Ancient Kingdoms, but included alſo the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf, and all the Seas about <hi>Arabia,</hi> and all that vaſt Tract of Ocean which extends from <hi>Capè bone Eſperance,</hi> even beyond the River <hi>Ganges:</hi> And the later Weſtern Writers have limited it only to this Gulph, becauſe it lies the neareſt, and was firſt diſcover'd to them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they contend, that becauſe King <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rythros,</hi> who was Maſter of this Sea, was interr'd in one of its Iſlands, it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Name of <hi>Mare Erithraeum,</hi> which ſignifies the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Latines</hi> and others from thence, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the ſame Appellation.

For in the ſame Degree <hi>North,</hi> as Mariners obſerve, particularly where there is not the Extent of ſo wide an Ocean, the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Air is not ſo perceptible. The reaſon of it may be the ſpacious ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tract of Sea, which gives the Air once agitated, more liberty to continue its motion, and conſtantly to increaſe its Coldneſs; which on the contrary, is ſtraitn'd and repreſs'd on Land, by the meeting of Mountains, Trees, Houſes, and other Obſtacles, and therefore not ſo impetuous; neither ſo Cold, becauſe the Sulphureous Vapours which ariſe from the Earth, and make fiery Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, often intermixing with the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, which make Wind, qualify them
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:43688:256"/>
in ſome meaſure. As at <hi>Suratt,</hi> the Winds are by much Hotter, which fly over the Land to us, than thoſe that come from the Sea.

                        <note place="margin">A Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> blackneſs.</note>It might ſeem here a rational Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture for the reaſon of the <hi>Negroes</hi> Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they are burnt by the Sun's Beams, which we experimentally find tinctures the faireſt Complexions, when it comes near them, which recover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by withdrawing to a cooler Air. And therefore that thoſe who are moſt expos'd to the Sun's Heat ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be the Blackeſt. For Blackneſs and Whiteneſs are not ſuppos'd natural to any People whatever, 'tis preſum'd to be the effect of the Climate, becauſe thoſe that are Fair by living a long time under or near the Line, ſhall in two or three Generations, as 'tis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, become tawny and Black, tho' they Marry only with fair People. But methinks there is ſomething in Nature which ſeems to thwart this current O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. For under the ſame Parallels are People of quite different Colours; as for inſtance, the <hi>Hotantots,</hi> who live
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:43688:258"/>
between thirty four and thirty five De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are Black; the Inhabitants of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> who are under the ſame Elevation of the Pole, are White. The People of <hi>England</hi> are white, and the Natives near <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s <hi>Bay,</hi> which is as Cold and <hi>Northerly</hi> a Climate, are Black. And neither the Colony of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> near <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s <hi>Bay,</hi> nor the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Cape Bone Eſperanſe</hi> receive any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Colour, but are freſh and fair as in <hi>Europe,</hi> and yet the Natives in both parts are Olive-colour'd. Some are apt to aſcribe this to the Air and Climate or Earth, which in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces produces Patagons, who are Giants, as in other, Pygmies; but this ſeems weak and unaccountable. Others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve much of it into the effect of Food and Diet, which I believe may be of ſome power, and efficacy in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon this Account. Becauſe at <hi>Suratt,</hi> I obſerv'd a young <hi>Indian</hi> very Black, taken into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service, who by taſting Wine and Eating Fleſh, grew paler ſenſibly than he was before. The ſtrong Aliment by a frequent mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its lively Juyces with the Blood and Spirits, which for a long time had been kept low by a Phlegmatick Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:43688:259"/>
did actuate and purify them by degrees, and thereby ſhew'd in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the effect of their fermentation by a faint Varniſh upon the Face. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is a Remark of the Ancients, but not methinks very ſound, whereby they took notice, that 'tis the Humidity of the Elements, which defends the <hi>Indians</hi> againſt that Action of the Sun, which burns the Complexion of the <hi>Negroes;</hi> and makes their Hair grow like Cotton; whereas ſome of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whoſe Hair is long and uncurled, live as near the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and endure as intenſe a Heat as the <hi>Hotantots</hi> and ſeveral Negroes of <hi>Africa,</hi> whoſe Hair is criſp and frizl'd.

they are far from being Curious either in their Food or Attire, any further than what they find Nature reaches forth to them. They think it a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Toil to ſpend time in dreſſing of the Hides of Bulls, or in Spinning and Weaving the Wool of Sheep, for Ornaments and Covering to their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. They are ſatisfied with the ſame wrought Garments that Nature has clad the Sheep with, and therefore without more Labour or Art, they take them from the Backs of the Sheep, and put them preſently upon their own, and ſo they walk with that Sheep-Skin Mantle about their Shoulders, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thrown like a Hood over their Heads, which ſeem to be the Ancienteſt Garments, according to <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.21. <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Adam <hi>and his Wife did the Lord make Coats of Skins.</hi> They generally turn the Wool inwards, that the outſide of the Garment may defend them from Rain, and the inſide from the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Cold. The Ornaments about their Heads are ſmall Shells, or little pieces of Lead or Iron faſten'd to their friz'ld Hair, or put into their Ears. The Hair of their Heads, and of all their

Stinking Greaſe is their ſweet Oil, and the Duſt of the Streets the Powder of their Hair. They Anoint their Bodies to render their Nerves ſupple and active, and to fortifie the Pores againſt the Violence of the ambient Air. For they are both nimble and ſwift of Foot, and of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to outface and worſt a Lion.

                     <p>The Apparel of the Women upon the upper part of the Body is the ſame with the Men's; but round their Legs are twiſted Sheeps Guts two or three Inches thick, which are ſerviceable upon a double account, both for Food and Ornament. The Guts, which are
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:43688:260"/>
made more ſavoury by the Dirt which ſticks to them, affords them as good a Meal as the Fleſh of the Sheep, and are eaten with as good a Guſto.</p>
                     <p>The Huts they dwell in,<note place="margin">Their Huts which they dwell in.</note> which are made of Bul-Ruſhes, or Branches of Trees, are faſhion'd round almoſt like a Bee-hive, reaching about five Foot high, and nine broad, with a ſmall Paſſage in the ſide to creep in at, and a Hole in the middle for the Fire.</p>
                     <p>They diſallow Polygamy in all, but in their Chief, who may entertain three Wives at once. And the kind Wives, after the Death of every Husband,<note place="margin">The Wives penance for a dead Husband.</note> if they Marry again, cut off a Joint from the little Finger, and proceed to the middle, if they Bury many.

this Iſland, becauſe the leanneſs of the Ground, and want of Moiſture, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them no more than a bare ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which yet ſecure their Lives from the violence of Famin and of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners.</p>
                     <p>The method made uſe of in taking the Turtle,<note place="margin">A Diſcourſe concerning the Turtle.</note> is carefully to obſerve thoſe particular times they come on Shoar, to lay or hatch their Eggs, at which times they turn them by ſurprizal upon their Backs, which is a Poſture they are utterly unable to recover from, and are thereby fruſtrated of all Defence or Eſcape, and are a ready Prey to any that reſolves to ſeize them. When the ſenſible Creatures find themſelves in this deſperate Poſture, by which they know themſelves in a loſt and hopeleſs ſtate, they then begin to lament their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in many heavy ſighs, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Groans, and ſhed abundance of water from their Eyes, in hopes, if poſſible, to ſecure their Safety by their Tears, and Mollifie the cruel Aſſaults upon their Lives. They are of celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtrength, much beyond the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their Bulk, ſo much that I have ſeen one of a ſmall ſize, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:43688:271"/>
eight Inches Broad, able to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the weight of a Man. And the inward ſtrength of their Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is equal to that of their outward Contexture, which is not eaſily abated or diſſolved. For after the Neck of one of theſe had been quite cut off, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only a ſmall piece of Skin by which it hung to the Body; and after its Bowels were ripp'd up, and its Heart was taken out, and plac'd upon the Deck of the Ship, it both open'd its Mouth, and the Heart for a long time after had a motion; which ſome of the Spectators affirm'd would continue for the ſpace of two or three Hours; and ſome of them have been known to live twelve Hours after their Heads have been cut off. The parts of Reptiles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, I think, animated for ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time after they are diſſected from one another, becauſe of the viſcous Quality of their Animal Spirits, but for the Heart of ſo large an Animal as this, to move for ſome Hours after it was torn from the Body, ſeems a little more ſtrange and ſurprizing. However, I made this Experiment my ſelf upon a Cock-Roach, which is a ſort of large unwieldy
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:43688:271"/>
Flie, whoſe Spirits may be preſum'd to be moſt volatile, the Head of which I ſever'd from the Body, and kept it apart in a ſmall Box for twenty four Hours, after which time looking on it, I ſaw it perfectly move ſome parts, but with a very faint ſlowneſs. As we ſee the Fleſh of a Viper, after it is beheaded and imboweled, will move for the ſpace of 24 Hours.</p>
                     <p>Of the Turtle or Marine Tortoiſe,<note place="margin">Three ſorts of Turtles.</note> there are three ſorts, the Hawk-Bill, the Logerhead, and the Green Turtle, which ſwim in the Water, and creep upon Land. 'Tis of ſuch an Amphibious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that you may fancy it Beaſt, or Bird, or Fiſh, as you pleaſe; for it lives in the Ocean like a Fiſh; it feeds upon Graſs on Shoar, as an Ox; and lays Eggs, as a Bird, ſometimes the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Buſhel. The two Fins of it pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before, are in the ſhape of Wings; thoſe two behind are broad and long like Feet, and its Head and Eyes, which it opens and ſhuts, reſemble thoſe of a Hawk; ſo that both in its ſhape and other qualities, the Body of it is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among thoſe Creatures whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Elements are Land, Water, and
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:43688:272"/>
Air. The fleſh of it is White, and Eats beyond any Veal, and admirably contributes to the Cure of the Scurvey, and as it's commonly affirmed, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Diſeaſe. But the <hi>Dutch,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the delicacy, will not touch it; and the Barbarity of the <hi>French,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have been ſatiated with their Plenty, expoſe them to ſtarve and ſtink above Ground, by leaving many of them turn'd upon their Backs, upon their departure from the Iſland. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> treat none cruelly, but turn on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as are neceſſary for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, being loath to expreſs a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to the very Beaſts, eſpecially ſuch whoſe Deaths contribute ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably to the Health, and ſupport of their own Lives. Great plenty of theſe Shel-Fiſh are found in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> the Genitals of which dried, and drunk in Wine, are preſcribed as ſingular Diſſolvers of the Stone. The ſtore of them upon this Iſland, where ſo little Herbage grows, ſeems to ſupply the Neceſſity of green Herbs for Curing the Scorbutick Humours in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, to which nothing does contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more; as we happily experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:43688:272"/>
in the Voyage. For three or four <hi>French</hi> Vineroons deſigned for St. <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> were ſo lamentably over-run with the Scurvey, after we had ſpent two or three Months at Sea,<note place="margin">The Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey Cur'd by Eating green herbs</note> that they were unable either to walk or ſtand upright; and yet three days eating of Purſlain and other Herbs, after we were landed in <hi>Africa,</hi> rectifyed the ill Humours in the Blood, reſtor'd their Limbs, and recover'd their Stomachs and loſt Health again. And were thoſe made more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Diet of theſe that live on Land, as they are ſometimes of thoſe at Sea, I doubt not but the Scorbutick Humours, and all that Train of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that follows them, would be leſs numerous and prevailing than they are.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE Account of this Revolution, and thoſe other matters which are diſcours'd of in this Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, might have fallen in very luckily in ſome part of the preceding Voyage,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:43688:276"/>
had I been ſo fortunate as to have had the peruſal of the Papers while the Book was a finiſhing; but not coming to my Hands 'till it was Printed, I thought it beſt to affix them to it, as both agreeable to the Subject, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining things in them very remarkable and New: And muſt needs own the peculiar Obligation I am under to a very worthy Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Daniel Sheldon,</hi> in the free and kind Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of theſe Memoirs. I ſhall not therefore detain the Reader with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further account of this matter, but paſs on to what I am ſatisfied will be very agreeable to him, <hi>viz.</hi> The Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Revolution in <hi>Golconda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The preſent King of <hi>Golconda</hi> was Son to an <hi>Arabian</hi> of good Family and Eſteem, but low in Eſtate and Fortune; to raiſe which, reſolving to Travel, and ſeek Employment from ſome Foreign Prince, he came to <hi>Golconda;</hi> and, by the Favour of ſome perſons of Quality, had the opportunity of preſenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Service to King <hi>Cotub ſha;</hi> who, being pleaſed with his Perſon and manner of Addreſs, gave him a ſmall Government, wherein he behav'd
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:43688:276"/>
himſelf ſo well, that he was advanc'd to one of the moſt conſiderable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the Kingdom, in which and his Prince's favour he continued 'till his Death: After which his Eſtate (being very great) was ſeiz'd on by the King, who is the general Heir of all his Nobles and Perſons employ'd by him (none of thoſe Countreys having any Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eſtates) ſo that his Son was reduc'd to a very poor Condition; but, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that left which could not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, <hi>viz.</hi> his Father's Wit and Courage, he reſolv'd to follow his Example, hoping to find his Fortune. Full of which hopes he enters himſelf into <hi>Munſub</hi> (that is, the Kings Pay) and had allow'd him twelve or fifteen new <hi>Pagotha</hi>'s (which is about four Pounds ſixteen Shillings, or ſix Pounds Sterling) <hi>per</hi> Month, with which, and the hopes of better Preferment, he made a ſhift to maintain himſelf. The King <hi>Cotub-ſha</hi> had at this time no Son, but three Daughters; the Eldeſt of which was Married to Sultan <hi>Mamood,</hi> Eldeſt Son to the <hi>Great Mogul, Aureng-Zebe:</hi> The ſecond to an <hi>Arabian</hi> of great Quality, <hi>Meera Mamood;</hi> and the
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:43688:277"/>
third was unmarried: To this unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Daughter an <hi>Arabian</hi> of high Birth and Quality called <hi>Siud Sultan,</hi> was an importunate Suitor; and the King grown Old, and oppreſs'd with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of thoſe to whom he had left the management of Affairs (having all his time wholly minded Pleaſures, and left Buſineſs and the Concerns of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Cares of others) and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hating Sultan <hi>Mamood</hi> (who by a cruel War, almoſt to the utter Ruine of him and his Kingdom, had forc'd his Conſent to the Marryage of his Eldeſt Daughter, hoping thereby, after <hi>Cotub-ſha</hi>'s Death, to add the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda</hi> to the Empire of the <hi>Great Mogul)</hi> and having no Kindneſs for his ſecond Daughter or her Husband, but being extreamly fond of his Youngeſt, he deſign'd to Marry her to one whoſe Quality, Parts, and Courage, might make him able either to break or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Factions of his Court; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Sultan <hi>Mamood,</hi> who he reſolv'd ſhould not ſucceed him; and one, who being rais'd by his Favour, he thought would wholly depend upon it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by only expect the Succeſſion. And
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:43688:277"/>
this Young Servant to his Daughter, being an <hi>Arabian</hi> (who in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys are thought the Wiſeſt and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for Government) and of the Caſt of the <hi>Siuds</hi> (that is of the Family or Kindred of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much reverenc'd by all) likewiſe of a brisk and lively Wit and Spirit: He thought him a fit Perſon by whom to manage his Deſigns, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to Marry his Daughter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore countenanc'd his Adreſſes to her; but the young Man was ſo dazled with the proſpect of ſo glorious a Fortune, that he could not ſee his right way to it; for, preſuming too ſoon upon the King and Princeſſes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, inſtead of contriving how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſtrengthen his Intereſt, by gaining the Conſent and Support of the great Miniſters of State; he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelf ſo inſolently towards them, that he utterly diſoblig'd, and made himſelf hateful to them; and they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tyranny of one who, when their Equal, began to exerciſe it over them, reſolv'd to diſgrace and ruin him, by hindring the Match. The chiefeſt Perſons about the King, were <hi>Moſo
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:43688:278"/>
Cawne, Siud Meer Zapher,</hi> and <hi>Musſhuke,</hi> theſe three managed the King and his great Affairs; for <hi>Meera Mamood,</hi> the King's Son in Law, being not in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, was not in Buſineſs; yet not ſo quite laid aſide, but that he had free Acceſs to the Court and Preſence, and was by all reſpected as one, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Married the King's Second Daughter (Circumſtances conſider'd) was likely enough to ſucceed him. Therefore having great hopes (and not enduring the Inſolent Carriage of this new Favourite, nor to think of his Marrying the King's beloved Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) put himſelf in the Head of the Faction againſt him: And the Old Courtiers perfectly knowing the King, and the uſual and ſureſt ways of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to their Deſigns, ſoon unſetled the unwary young Man in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and then threw him from the height of his Prince's Favour, to the contempt and ſcorn of the meaneſt Subject. For they poſſeſſed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with an Opinion, that he was an high Spirited, Ambitious Man, and aim'd at great things; that he was at the Head of a great Party and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:43688:278"/>
at Court; that if he were once ſtrengthen'd with ſo near an Alliance to the King, he might do whatſoever he deſign'd; what he deſign'd they knew not, but he gave them great Reaſon to fear, it was not his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's ſafety, nor the Kingdom's Peace; and Affairs being wholy manag'd by their Directions, and all Officers at Court about the King being their Creatures, they made their Information ſeem more than probable. The King being naturally jealous, and frighted with the Shadow of any thing that he thought might diſturb his Pleaſures, was quickly perſwaded not to marry the Princeſs to ſo dangerous a Perſon, and immediately upon the breaking off the Match, one of the three Perſons before mention'd, ('tis not certainly known which of them, but thought <hi>Musſhuke)</hi> advis'd his Majeſty to find out ſome one for the Princeſs of ſmall Fortune, but noble Birth and Courage; a comly Perſon, and of a generous and chearful Diſpoſition, and inclin'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Pleaſures than Buſineſs; for, if he was qualified with high Birth, and the Endowments of Nature, it lay in
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:43688:279"/>
the King's Power to ſupply the Defects of Honour, Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Men of ſuch Diſpoſitions (being given to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) were ſeldom ambitious or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning; therefore ſuch a one being Created meerly by his Favour, would wholly ſubmit by it, and enjoying what he moſt deſir'd, (his Pleaſures) would not diſturb himſelf or them with the thoughts of Buſineſs, or Cares of Government, but be Obedient and perfectly contented with the Condition he was in, without aſpiring to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Greatneſs. The Advice was liked, and communicated to the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Counſelors, who (conſidering it was a way for continuing them in their Governments, and all Affairs and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their management) confirmed the King, by approving of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel given him; and having his Order to find out ſuch a Perſon, the Young <hi>Arabian</hi> Souldier (whoſe Father's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate had been ſeiz'd on by the King) was propos'd as one every way qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified according to the King's deſire. He is therefore ſent for by <hi>Ziud Meer Zapher</hi> to his Houſe, and (the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plac'd where he might perfectly
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:43688:279"/>
ſee and hear, without being taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of) <hi>Ziud Meer Zapher</hi> entertain'd the Young Souldier with ſome Diſcourſe concerning the Greatneſs and Merits of his Father; how much he was belov'd and favour'd by the King; told him he was ſorry to ſee the Son of ſo great a Man in ſo low a Condition; promis'd his Aſſiſtance in getting ſome handſom Command for him; bid him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be chearful and not dejected and Melancholy: And after he thought the King had fully view'd, diſmiſs'd him. When he was gone, the King told <hi>Ziud Meer Zapher,</hi> he was not ſo comly a Perſon as he was preſented to be, nor had he that Life and Vigour in his Countenance, that he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have in the Perſon he made choice of. To which <hi>Meer Zapher</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, that his Majeſty rather ſaw his Misfortunes than the Man himſelf; for, being the Son of ſo great a Perſon, and having liv'd in all the plenty of his Father's Great Eſtate, to be now reduc'd to the poor Condition and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of an Ordinary Horſe-man, muſt of neceſſity make melancholy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions both upon his Body and
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:43688:280"/>
Mind; but if his Wants were ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Money to maintain him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Birth and Quality, he would quickly come to, and appear like himſelf, and to be ſuch a one as his Majeſty ſought for. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to try, and therefore orders <hi>Meer Zapher</hi> to contrive how to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with as much Money as he would have, without letting him know the Bountiful Hand that reliev'd him. Immediately ſome <hi>Xeruffs,</hi> (or Money Merchants) are ſent for, and <hi>Meer Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> gives them directions to offer and let him have as much Money as he would take, promiſing to ſee them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid again; but ſtrictly Commanded them (upon the forfeiture, not only of their Money, but Lives) not to let him know they had any ſuch Order to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him. Away the <hi>Xeruffs</hi> go and give him ſeveral Viſits, under a pretence of deſiring his Aſſiſtance in ſome Buſineſs they had with ſome great Men; for, he being a Man of high Birth and Quality (ſuch Perſons tho' never ſo poor, being by all much reſpected in thoſe Countries) would have better Acceſs, and be ſooner heard and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:43688:280"/>
notice of. After two or three Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, growing more familiar with him, they told him he looked Melancholy and Diſcontented, and deſir'd to know if it were for want of any thing with which they could furniſh him; if Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they would ſupply him with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sum he would pleaſe to take; and deſir'd him to try them for two or three Thouſand Old <hi>Pagotha's,</hi> (which is about a Thouſand or fifteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds Sterling) His Wants made him ready enough to take Money, but (conſidering who they were that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd it, and that ſuch kindneſſes from ſuch Men were always paid for at the deareſt Rates) though his Condition was bad, he was unwilling to make it worſe, by putting himſelf into ſuch Mens Clutches; for, being once in their Debts, he could not foreſee any hopes of ever getting out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not ſacrifice his Liberty, and the little Content he had left, to his Inclination (which but two ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly perſwaded him to enjoy the preſent Conveniences of the Money offer'd, without troubling himſelf with the Thoughts of future Payment) but
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:43688:281"/>
reſolv'd to content himſelf in his Wants, till they were by ſome better and more agreeable way provided for: So re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd their Money, but accepted of their Kindneſs in the moſt grateful and obliging manner he poſſibly could. But at laſt the importunity of the <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruffs,</hi> and his own Wants, prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to receive a conſiderable Sum, for which (to his great Admiration) they were ſo far from taking Security, (as accuſtomary) that they perſwaded him not to ſpare his Money, but to live like the Son of ſo great a Father, offering him more, when that which he had received was ſpent. The young Man, naturally inclin'd to Gallantry and high Living, being thus plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplyed with the Means, reſolves to pleaſe and appear like himſelf with a handſom Houſe, Retinue, Palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keen, Horſes, and all things fit for a Perſon of his Quality; more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Merchants for lending, than at himſelf for Spending ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. All this while <hi>Siud Meer Zapher</hi> had his Eye upon him, and quickly perceived the alteration he expected both in his Perſon and Humour, and
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:43688:281"/>
that he began to be very much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd and reſpected by all that knew him: So deſires the King to ſee him again, which he does, and now ſo well likes him, that he gives <hi>Meer Zapher</hi> Order to let him have as many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of ſeeing him as he could; and the oftner he does ſee, the more he is pleas'd and taken with him: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolving to Marry his Daughter immediately to him, one Evening he ſends the <hi>Deveer</hi> or Secretary of State, with an <hi>Omrah</hi> (or Noble Man) called <hi>Jabber Beague,</hi> and a Guard of Horſe, to fetch and Conduct him to Court. The Young Gallant was entertaining ſome Friends and himſelf with ſome Dancing Women, when News was brought him that ſome great Officers belonging to the Court, were at the Door; away went his Friends and Women by a Back-way, and he to meet the Secretary and <hi>Jabber Beague,</hi> to conduct them in: As ſoon as he ſaw them (well knowing who they were) he was very much troubled, not imagining why ſo Eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with a Guard of Horſe, ſhould come to viſit him: And his Fears
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:43688:282"/>
were very much increas'd by a rich Veſt with which the Secretary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with from the King: <hi>For verily believing it was poiſon'd, he deſir'd them to Excuſe him, for being ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, that he could not tell whether to receive the King's Preſent as his Honour or Diſgrace and Ruine; for his Father's Services being long ſince Rewarded and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, and he having never yet the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of doing his Majeſty any, he could not expect any honourable Notice could be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of him; and yet he was in hopes he leſs deſerv'd Puniſhment than Reward, ſince he could not call to mind any one Crime he had committed in his whole Life, that might give his Majeſty the leaſt, or any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: And if his late living in a more plentiful way than formerly had been taken notice of, and was diſpleaſing, he did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them he had no other deſign in it, than to appear according to his Birth and Quality; that upon the leaſt Command or notice he would have retir'd to his former Obſcurity; that he had done no unjuſt thing to get the Money he ſpent, but would have been willing to have given, either his Majeſty or them an Account how he did get it. Then he told them he always
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:43688:282"/>
had been, and ſtill was ſo truly Loyal to his Prince; that he ſhould upon all occaſions, freely have ventur'd his Life for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and now durſt loſe it for his Pleaſure. So ſnatching the Veſt for to put it on, he deſir'd the Secretary to preſent his humble Duty to the King, and tell him he very much fear'd he would have more reaſon to Cheriſh and Preſerve ſuch Subjects as he was, than to delight and ſport himſelf in the Contrivance of their Deaths.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Secretary was, by Order, ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obſerve both what he ſaid, and how he behav'd himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not interrupt him, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted none but himſelf and <hi>Jabber Beague</hi> to help him on with his Veſt; after which with a low <hi>Salam</hi> (or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) he told him they were not ſent by the King to Execute any Sentence of his Diſpleaſure, but to conduct him to his Favour, and the greateſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he could beſtow upon him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſir'd him to go along with them chearfully and immediately. So with them he goes, not very well aſſur'd of his Safety, 'till they brought him a goodly Horſe with rich Furniture, and deſir'd him to mount, which he did,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:43688:283"/>
and betwixt the Secretary and <hi>Jabber Beague</hi> rode to Court, where he was the ſame Night Married to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: And the whole buſineſs was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with ſo much privacy, that <hi>Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Mamood</hi> (who had Married the King's ſecond Daughter) had not the leaſt knowledge of it, 'till it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly declared to whom the King had Married the Young Princeſs: Which made <hi>Meera Mamood</hi> almoſt mad with Rage, railing at the King, and his Nobility; but perceiving no body took notice of it, but thoſe that laugh'd at and deſpis'd him, he left the Court and Kingdom, and went to <hi>Delly,</hi> where making his Addreſſes to <hi>Aureng-Zebe,</hi> the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> he was kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and allow'd a Royal Penſion. The King is every Day more and more ſatisfied with his Son in Law, yet (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolv'd not to truſt him with any Command or Buſineſs, nor to give him any opportunity of inriching himſelf, or getting more Money than he ſpent) gives him no <hi>Munſub</hi> (that is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Souldiers, nor Government of any place or Province) and orders one of his Eunuchs conſtantly to pay his
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:43688:283"/>
Expences be they never ſo great, but not to furniſh him with any Money, thereby to give him opportunity of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up any. The Young Sultan ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Excellent Underſtanding, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiv'd the Deſign, and wiſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to comply with it, and be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly govern'd and manag'd by the King's pleaſure, without taking any notice of his Jealouſie: So he ſeems not to care for, nor ſo much as to think of any Command, Buſineſs, or getting of more Money than would pay for his Pleaſures, which did not only fix the <hi>Omrahs</hi> (or Nobles) and Governours to him (they verily believing that if he were once King, they ſhould be all ſuch in their general Governments) but made the King himſelf even dote on him, as a Man ſent from Heaven to Marry his Daughter, being juſt ſuch a Perſon, as in his thoughts he had wiſh'd for. He therefore contrives by all the ways he could deſire to ſecure the Succeſſion to him, for, being ſick and worn with Age and Pleaſures (to which he had been all his time wholly addicted) and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould die, he ſummons all his <hi>Omrahs</hi> before him, and publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:43688:284"/>
for his Succeſſor <hi>Sultan Abdulla Hooſan</hi> his Son in Law; conjuring them by the laſt Requeſt of their Dying King to ſettle him (after his Death) in the Throne, and to ſubmit to his Government; making them, one by one, not only promiſe, but ſwear upon their Alcharon to perform what he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; after which he immediately dyed, having liv'd above Eleven Years ſince the Marriage of his beloved Daughter, who in that ſpace of time had comforted him with a Son and two Daughters. The King was no ſooner dead, but his ſecond Daughter (Wife to <hi>Meera Mamood)</hi> having made a ſmall Party, ſeizes upon, and ſecures the Palace on the behalf of a Son her Husband had by a former Wife, (for by her he had none) whom ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to make King; but <hi>Moſo Cawne, Siud Meer Zapher,</hi> and <hi>Musſhuke,</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppreſſed the Tumult ſhe had made, and immediatel proclaim'd <hi>Sultan Abdul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Hooſan Potſhaw,</hi> or Prince <hi>Abdulla Hooſan</hi> Emperour.</p>
                     <p>After all the Ceremonies both of a Funeral and Coronation were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, the King begins to think of
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:43688:284"/>
gratifying thoſe that had made him ſo; for tho' he had long obſerv'd <hi>Moſo Cawne,</hi> and <hi>Siud Meer Zapher,</hi> to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ill Governours, yet they had done him good Service, and he could not, without leſſening his Name in the World, but continue, and ſomething increaſe their Honour and Commands: (nor perchance was it in his power to leſſen them in either, ſince thoſe that had made him King, might ſtill be made able to make another ſo) yet it very much troubled him to think he ſhould add to the too great Power they already had; therefore taking ſome little time to conſider what was fit for him to do, at laſt he concludes, that the way to leſſen theſe two powerful Noble-men, was to make them both too great, for very well knowing they mortally hated one another, and would never endure each others greatneſs, but be always ſtriving which ſhould throw the other out of his Prince's Favour, he therefore reſolv'd ſo to divide the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Affairs between them, that they ſhould be ſure to check one the other, and to carry himſelf ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, that it ſhould not be diſcern'd
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:43688:285"/>
which he moſt favour'd; by which he both anſwer'd the Opinion the World had of his Bounty, (a thing much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded) in rewarding them with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and great Imployments, and yet ſecur'd himſelf from the danger of two ſuch powerful Subjects, by making them too great ever to agree in an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt againſt him; and ſetting them both up at ſo equal and ſpreading a height, that they muſt of neceſſity juſtle one another down; concluding they could not be dangerous to him, while they were ſo to one another; and ſought only by the advantage of his Favour to ruine each other. To <hi>Moſo Cowne</hi> he therefore gives the Title of <hi>Cawne Cawna,</hi> and being a Man of Courage, makes him General of his Army. To <hi>Siud Meer Zapher</hi> he gives the Title of <hi>Emir Zemla,</hi> and being a Man of Buſineſs, makes him <hi>Duan</hi> (in which Office is comprehended both that of a Chancellour and Treaſurer) ſo that the General being to receive the Army's Pay of the <hi>Duan</hi> was ſure to find delays and affronts, and the <hi>Duan</hi> being by his Place to inſpect into the Diſpoſal of the King's Money, and Payment of the
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:43688:285"/>
After the King had honoured and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded others likewiſe that deſerved well of him, he ſeems wholly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from Buſineſs to his Pleaſures; but poſted himſelf at ſo convenient a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that he had perfect Knowledge of every thing that paſs'd. In this time of leaſure he would often ſequeſter himſelf from all kind of Company, to meditate and write; and its ſince cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known, that when he was thus retir'd, he took particular notice of all the Abuſes in the State, and the beſt ways of redreſſing them; likewiſe ſet down in Writing ſeveral Rules and Maxims for his future Government.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the two great men (or rather Kings) ſtrove who ſhould procure the fineſt Women, beſt Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels and Dancers to divert the King, thinking by ſuch Charms to continue him in the Lethargy they thought he was in. But what the Wiſe Prince foreſaw ſoon came to paſs; for they (not enduring each others Greatneſs, and inrag'd at the equal Favour of the King) endeavour'd, by finding out mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Accuſation aginſt, to ruin each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the <hi>Duan</hi> (being by his place
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:43688:286"/>
to inſpect into the Payment of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) receiv'd many Complaints againſt the General, whoſe wretched love of Money made him defraud the King and his Souldiers of great Sums. Of this the <hi>Duan</hi> complains to the King, who ſeems not to believe, and takes little notice of it. The <hi>Duan</hi> therefore reſolving to bring ſuch Evidence as ſhould convince the King of the Truth of his Complaint, ſeizes the General's <hi>Braman</hi> or Accountant, who kept all the Accounts of the Army; at which the General is ſo inrag'd, that taking ſome Souldiers with him, he is reſolv'd to go and cut the <hi>Duan</hi> in pieces; but the <hi>Duan,</hi> being a notorious Coward, is the more careful to have Valiant Men about him, and always paying them well, they now ſerve him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſtoutly defending him againſt the General, 'till the King ſent and Commanded him to retire. At firſt he was ſo out of his Wits, that he would not, but (being perſwaded by better temper'd Men, and his Friends) at laſt he return'd to his own Houſe, leaving the <hi>Duan</hi> half dead with Fear; who coming to himſelf, goes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:43688:286"/>
to the King, and deſires him to conſider with what ſafety he could be in his Palace, if ſuch Outrages were committed in the Garriſon. The King calmly tells him, he will take care both for his own, and his future ſafety, by preventing ſuch Violences for the time to come, and by perfectly reconciling the General to him; and tho' the <hi>Duan</hi> knew that to be impoſſible, yet ſeems to go away contented. The King ſends to the General to let him know that he had undertaken a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore would have him frame himſelf to it; but he ſtorms, and calls the <hi>Duan</hi> a thouſand Names; at laſt better remembring, calms himſelf, returns the King Thanks, and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to what he ſhall Command. Some few days after the King ſends for him (as accuſtomary) and he (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by that time conſidered the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what he had done) is unwilling to go, but (being perſwaded by ſome he thought Friends, there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that the King had inwardly more kindneſs for him than for the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an)</hi> to Court he goes, and was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er entred the <hi>Palace Yard,</hi> but is ſeiz'd
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:43688:287"/>
on, and clapt into Irons and Priſon.</p>
                     <p>The Charge againſt him was for ſlighting the King's Commands; da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to aſſault one of his Counſellours within his Garriſon; purloyning the King's Treaſure, and converting it to his own Uſe; and for refuſing to pay ſeveral Sums of Money to the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> very much to the Diſhonour of the King; (he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſs'd his word for the punctual Payment of them) for which and ſome other things he was Impriſon'd, and had all his Eſtate ſeiz'd on; in his Houſe being found in ready Money, Five Hundred Thouſand new <hi>Pagotha</hi>'s (which is about Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds Sterling) beſides Jewels, wherein he was very Rich, having for many Years been Governour of the <hi>Diamond</hi> Mine of <hi>Coulour.</hi> Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after he was ſeiz'd on, the King muſter'd the Army, pays them their Arrears, gives the Command to <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuke;</hi> but, to their great ſatisfaction, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolls them in his own Rolls, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to take care of them himſelf for the Future. The <hi>Duan</hi> is infinitely pleas'd at the fall of the General, and
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:43688:287"/>
thinking he had no Equal in the King's Favour, takes upon him to meddle in every Man's matter, depriving ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Benefit of their Places, by taking their Buſineſs out of their Hands; and the King lets him go on without taking notice of ſmall Preſumptions, ſo that by degrees he grows ſo confident of his own Authority, and the King's neglect, that he begins to do things of the greateſt Conſequence, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting his Majeſty; and at laſt (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made himſelf hateful, by doing and undoing every Man's Buſineſs, according to his own Intereſt and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns) his Ruin was ſo generally wiſh'd, that there was a neceſſity of removing ſo great a grievance; which gave the King a fit opportunity of doing what he had ſo long deſign'd. Notice is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given, that ſuch a Morning the King intends to appear at the <hi>Durbar;</hi> (that is at the place where he uſually ſhows himſelf to his Nobles) ſo that the <hi>Duan</hi> and all the reſt of his <hi>Omrahs</hi> (or Nobles) were to come according to Cuſtom to make their <hi>Salam.</hi> When the King was ſat, and had a little look'd about him, he commands the <hi>Duan</hi> to
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:43688:288"/>
ſtand before him, and began to ſpeak to him in ſo obliging a manner, that every one at firſt verily thought he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd him ſome freſh Honour, and not Diſgrace; telling him how particular a kindneſs he always had for his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; how great a Confidence in his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delities and Abilities; inſomuch that he had left almoſt the whole Affairs of his Kingdom to his management, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him, as it were, King in Power, and contenting himſelf only with the Name: But that, to his extreme Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, he found himſelf quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in him; for he had made uſe of the good Opinion he had of him, and his own great Abilities, only to Affront his King, and oppreſs and wrong his fellow Subjects. Then in the ſharpeſt Language he could ſpeak, tells him of all his Inſolencies and Affronts, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to do things of the greateſt conſequence without acquainting him; likewiſe reckons up all the Miſcarriages of his Adminiſtration; then telling him, that he preferring his own Honour, and the good of the Publick, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own Life, he could not expect he ſhould ſpare his, but Sacrifice it to
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:43688:288"/>
his own Vindication and publick Juſtice, on the behalf of his oppreſs'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Subjects: However as a Reward of ſome former good Services he had done, he gave him his Life and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſuch a Province, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him immediately (upon the forfeiture of both) to retire to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and for the future not to meddle with any Buſineſs but what concern'd it. And ſo, without further Diſgrace, diſmiſs'd him, not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any to affront him, but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to reſpect him as the Governour of a Province.</p>
                     <p>The King, with Reputation, and the infinite ſatisfaction of his People, having thus lad aſide his two Partners in the Government (as if he thought himſelf then and not before a King) leaves his Retirement; diſmiſſes the lew'd Women and Dancers; and breaks the Charms of his former Pleaſures, with the Thoughts of Buſineſs; which he wholly minds and delights in; appears frequently at the <hi>Durbar;</hi> inſpects into the whole Affairs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; calls for all the Accounts of
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:43688:289"/>
his Revenues, the auditing of which he leaves to <hi>Musſhuke</hi> (who is now the Favourite) rewards bountifully; puniſhes not with Death, but other ways, very ſeverely; giving his People great aſſurance of being happily Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd for the future, by a Wiſe and moſt excellent King.</p>

Beſides theſe outward Fortifications, it is defended by a Caſtle of that incredible ſtrength, that the King of <hi>Brama</hi> coming againſt it with Three Hundred Thouſand Men, and Forty Thouſand Elephants, was forc'd to raiſe the Siege with Diſgrace. Thro' the Valley runs a large River, which <hi>Maginus</hi> calls <hi>Chaberis,</hi> which dividing it ſelf into ſeveral little Rivolets and Streams, paſſes thro' all the ſtreets, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording thereby a wonderful Advantage to the City, by the ready Conveyance of all ſorts of Merchandiſes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions unto every part thereof. At its parting from the City, which is ſaid to be about Forty Five, or Fifty Miles from the Sea, all theſe little Rivolets are Collected again into two Channels, which opening towards the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> at length fall Weſtward into the
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:43688:291"/>
Gulph of <hi>Bengala,</hi> that towards the <hi>North</hi> at <hi>Orietan,</hi> and the other at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazi</hi> or <hi>Duabacam,</hi> both which places are much frequented by Merchants; but the alternate Ebbings and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Sea are ſo violent, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the time of the Full Moon, that the Ships can hardly ride ſafely in the Ports. But before we leave <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> to ſpeak of theſe places, it will be convenient to ſay ſomething of its Buildings, which are indeed ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mean; tho' there are ſeveral ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Piazza</hi>'s or <hi>Bazars,</hi> which afford both Conveniences for Markets, and tolerable Proſpects to the Spectators. For Timber they make uſe of <hi>Bambou</hi> Cane, and inſtead of Nails, tie the pieces together with the ſmaller ſort of the ſame Cane, which when ſlender and Green, is ſo pliable, that it may be wreathed and twiſted as you pleaſe. The Princes and Nobiliry make uſe of a different ſort of Wood, and are very profuſe in adorning the Inſides of their Houſes with exquiſite Carvings and Guildings. Nor are their common ſort deſtitute of Ornaments to ſet off and Beautifie them. The Palace Royal is
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:43688:291"/>
vaſtly large, but not ſo beautiful for its ſtructure. It is ſupported with large and tall Pillars, made of whole Trees, and cover'd over with Gold, with Chambers above built with the moſt precious and odoriferous Wood the <hi>Eaſt</hi> will afford, as Red and White Sandal, and a ſort of <hi>Bois de Aquila.</hi> In the Middle, and as it were Center of the Palace, ſtands a great Hall, which they call the <hi>Golden Houſe,</hi> becauſe the Inſide is wholly over-laid with Gold, from the Bottom to the Top, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a rais'd place hangs a Canopy of Maſſy Gold, round which hang above an Hundred <hi>Combalenghe,</hi> as they call them, which are large Wedges of the ſame Mettal, made in the Faſhion of Sugar-Loaves, each of above Forty Pound weigbt. Here alſo are to be ſeen ſeven Idols of maſſie Gold like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, of the heighth of an ordinary Man, and about two Fingers in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but within hollow; which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo adorn'd with precious Stones, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, Emeralds, Saphirs, and Diamonds, of an exiraordinary Bigneſs, upon their Foreheads, Breaſts, and Arms, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Middles. In the midſt of
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:43688:292"/>
this Hall ſtands a ſquare Stool, of three Hands breadth, all of pure Gold, which ſupports a Cabinet of pure Gold alſo, and overlaid with precious Stones, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the two <hi>Caneques, i. e.</hi> two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Pendants made in the Form of two Pyramids, of two Rubies of the length of a Man's little Finger, and the Circumference at the baſe, as wide as that of an ordinary Pullets Egg.</p>
                        <p>The Quarrel about theſe Jewels is ſaid to have cauſed as much Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed among the Neighbouring Kings hereabouts, as might have been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the obtaining an entire Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; the Conteſt being not ſo much for the value of the Jewels, as that they are ſuppos'd to bring along with them a right, or at leaſt a claim of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Neighbouring Princes. And now they are in the Hands of this King, but never worn by him, except upon the Day of his Coronation. In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Apartment ſtands the Statue of the King of <hi>Brama,</hi> treacherouſly Murther'd by his Subjects, ſo natural and to the Life, that it cauſes Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the Spectators, which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Numerous, he having obtain'd the
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:43688:292"/>
Reputation of a great Saint, and being fam'd for Curing the Diſeaſes of thoſe that reſort to him; eſpecially the Bloody Flux. In the whole City are numbred no leſs than ſix Hundred <hi>Pagods,</hi> or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol Temples, the Inhabitants amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an Hundred and Sixty Thouſand, beſides Merchants and Strangers; the City, as indeed the whole Kingdom, being ſaid to be very Populous. Not far from this Palace, there is a great Lake, with many ſmall Iſlands therein, which are Inhabited by their Prieſts, which they call <hi>Raulini.</hi> There are alſo conſtantly a great number of Boats running up and down in it, but hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd from all Communication with the City by a Bank, ſo contriv'd, that ſhould they be Beſieg'd, and overpowr'd by their Enemies, ſo as to be conſtrain'd to yield the City to them, they could overwhelm both it and them in a whole Deluge of Water, by breaking down that Bank.</p>
                        <p>From this City, paſſing down that Branch of the River,<note place="margin">Orietan.</note> which runs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, you come to <hi>Orie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;</hi> the whole Courſe of the River be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly delightful, the Banks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cover'd with tall Trees always

green and ſhady, which bending their Head towards the Water, make one continued Arbour, and defend the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers from the ſcortching Sun. And the variety of Apes or Peacocks flying or skipping from branch to branch, adds very much to the pleaſure of the Paſſage. <hi>Orietan</hi> is a City of great Concourſe of Merchants from moſt Countries of the <hi>Eaſt, Pegu, China, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, Malacca;</hi> and from <hi>Malabar</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and other parts of <hi>India.</hi> 'Tis govern'd by a Deputy appointed by the King at his Coronation, receiving a Crown from his Hand, and always enjoying the Title of King himſelf; this City being one of thoſe Twelve, the Capitals of Twelve Provinces, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Kingdom of <hi>Arracan;</hi> which are always govern'd by Crown'd Heads. Not far from this City ariſes the Mount of <hi>Maum,</hi> which imparts its Name to a Lake waſhing the Foot thereof; thither are ſent all thoſe that are Exil'd by the King, who cauſes ſtrict Guards to be kept in all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and further to prevent the flight of the Criminals, cuts off their Heels. The Mountain is hardly paſſable for
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:43688:293"/>
Travellers, being not only craggy and impervious, but ſo infeſted with wild Beaſts, that it is a difficult thing to eſcape them.</p>
                        <p>From the Mountain of <hi>Maum,</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Ramu</hi> is another City of equal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with <hi>Peroem,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ramu.</note> from which it is not many Days Journey diſtant, but he Way betwixt them very dangerous, whether by Land or by Water; The Sea being ſubject to ſudden tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Storms, and that by Land lying croſs the Mountains of <hi>Pre,</hi> which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate <hi>Arracan</hi> from <hi>Pegu,</hi> as dangerous, by reaſon of the Wild Beaſts, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. What is further taken notice of in there parts, is a Mountain called <hi>Pora,</hi> which in the Language of the Country ſignifies God, or an Idol; which Name it borrows from an Idol plac'd upon the very top thereof, ſitting croſs-legg'd
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:43688:294"/>
upon a Pedeſtal, to which thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens reſort with great Devotion. By this place runs a large River, from which ſome Engineers would have perſwaded the King to have cut a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel as far as <hi>Arracan;</hi> but he abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refus'd to hearken to the Propoſal, becauſe he thought he ſhould thereby expoſe the place of his Reſidence to the Incurſions of the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> who might with Eaſe convey his Forces down ſuch a Channel.</p>

Indeed this City, as well as <hi>Chatigam,</hi> which was undoubtedly once a City of this Kingdom, and the Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of commonly allotted to the King's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son, has run the riſque of Frontier Towns, frequently to change its Maſter, and to be ſometimes in the Hands of one of the Neighbouring Princes, and ſometimes in thoſe of the other.

'Tis about an Hundred Miles in Compaſs, and affords ſuch vaſt quantities of Salt, that it needs no other Commodities to give in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for any of thoſe of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries, being able with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to lade two Hundred Veſſels every Year.

1605. And not long after coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fort of <hi>Siriam</hi> with a Fleet of Twelve Hundred Sail, together with a Land Army of Thirty Thouſand Men, with three Thouſand five Hundred great and ſmall Canon, he was thrice beat both by Land and Sea, and forc'd to retire.</p>
                           <p>The Government is chiefly in the hands of Twelve Princes, to whom he gives the Title of Kings, reſiding in his Principal Cities, in Twelve Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Palaces built for the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; in all which are great Seraglio's, the Governour being oblig'd Yearly to chuſe Twelve Girls, born that year within their Precincts, who are brought up at the King's Charge, 'till they are twelve Years old, at which age being brought to his Court, he chuſes by the ſmell of their Garments, in which they have been made to ſweat, thoſe whoſe Scent pleaſes him, diſpoſing of the reſt to the Gentlemen of his Court.</p>

When any ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or other Calamity befalls them, their firſt Addreſſes are to him, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vows to him, if he will free them from their preſent Miſery, and ceaſe to afflict them for the future. Nor dare they omit the ſolemn Performance of theſe Vows, upon their Recovery. But chuſing a Man, whom they call the <hi>Father of the Devil,</hi> as being one of the greateſt of his Prieſts, and beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:43688:309"/>
or at leaſt pretending to do ſo, what will be moſt acceptable to him, to direct them, make a great Feaſt, attended with Muſick of all ſorts, to pacifie and appeaſe this incenſed Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. Many of them will run about the ſtreets in the Morning, with one hand full of Rice, and a Torch in the other, crying aloud, <hi>They go to give the Devil his Breakfaſt, that he might not hurt them all that Day.</hi> Others, before they eat, throw part of what they have over their Shoulders to feed him. And with ſuch a panick Fear are they ſtruck at the thoughts of this <hi>Author of Evil,</hi> that they will run, as if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poſſeſt, from a Man in a Mask, leſt he ſhould prove a Devil come out of Hell to torment them. And at a place call'd <hi>Tavay,</hi> they have a Cuſtom to repleniſh their Houſes with Victuals, and then leave them for three Months, that the Devils may come and dwell in them, feeding upon what they have provided; and to be propitious to them all the reſt of the Year.</p>
                           <p>They have an Order of Religious among them had in much eſteem, who
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:43688:309"/>
do frequently oppoſe this Diabolical Worſhip, but are not able to root out of the minds of the People, what their Fears have ſo deeply imprinted there. Theſe Religious they call <hi>Telapoi,</hi> who are not unlike <hi>Mendicant Fryers,</hi> living upon the Alms of the People, and ſo highly venerated by them, that they would be glad to drink the Water wherein they waſh their Hands. They are uſually of the very dregs of the People, but aſſume to themſelves great ſtare and Majeſty, walking thro' the ſtreets with a grave compos'd Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Gate, in long Robes girt with a leathern Girdle four Fingers broad, at which hangs a Bag in which they beſtow what they get. Their Heads are always cover'd, but they ſuffer not a hair to grow on them, or any other part of their Bodies. Their Habitations are in the Woods, in little kind of Neſts or Cages upon the Tops of the Trees, for fear of the Tygers that infeſt thoſe Parts. Every New Moon, others ſay, every <hi>Monday,</hi> they preach to the People, calling them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ſound of a Bell, or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and for the Subject of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:43688:310"/>
they generally make uſe of ſome Precept of the Law of Nature, as <hi>not to ſteal, not to commit Adultery, not to bear falſe Witneſs,</hi> &amp;c. a ſtrict performance whereof they think ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Salvation, however extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant they may be in matters of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Speculation. Nor do theſe lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarian Principles fail of a very good effect, making them very Charitable, and Hoſpitable to Strangers; nor in the leaſt diſpleas'd when any of their People embrace Chriſtianity, and are baptis'd. When they die, they are moſt ſumptuouſly interr'd at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the People, being burnt in a very coſtly Pile of the moſt precious Woods that can be got. Their Aſhes they caſt into the River, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their Bones they bury near the Hut where they liv'd.</p>
                           <p>In matters of Faith, beſides that Manichean Principle before mention'd, they hold divers others, hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it; as an eternal Succeſſion of Worlds, without Creation; and a multiplicity of Gods to govern them; as for Example, they ſay this preſent World is to be under the Government
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:43688:310"/>
of Five ſeveral Gods, of which four are already paſs'd; and now above two thouſand two hundred Years e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed ſince the Death of the laſt of theſe; ſo that they expect ſuddenly the coming of the Fifth, after whoſe Deceaſe, the World it ſelf is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by Fire, that a new one, Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix-like, may ſpring out of the Aſhes. The Souls of Men, they ſay, after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Tranſmigrations, attain the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Felicity of their Gods; which is no other than a ſtate of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation. For firſt they paſs thro' the Bodies of living Creatures, Beaſts, and Birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they are receiv'd into a place they call <hi>Naxac, i. e. the place of Torments.</hi> Whence they being, after a long Confinement, ſet free, they are admitted into <hi>Sevum,</hi> a ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for departed Souls; a place of all ſorts of ſenſual Pleaſures, and a true <hi>Mahometan</hi> Paradiſe. Having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd their time in this likewiſe, they arrive at their laſt and irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſtate, which they call <hi>Nibam,</hi> which imports as much among them as a total Privation of the Eſſence both of Soul and Body, or a ſtate of Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:43688:311"/>
But this is to be ſaid for them, that they are not ſo wedded to any of theſe Opinions, as not to be willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hearken to, and embrace o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrines, when they are made known to them.</p>
                           <p>They have a ſtrong Opinion of the Sanctity of Apes and Crocodiles; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they think them infallibly happy, who chance to be devoured by them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">Feſtivals.</note>Every Year they keep five ſolemn Feſtivals, which in their Language are by a general name called <hi>Sapans,</hi> and diſtinguiſh'd by the Names <hi>Giachie, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tena Giaimo, Segienod, Daiche</hi> and <hi>Donon;</hi> the firſt of theſe is ſolemniz'd about thirty ſix Miles from the City of <hi>Pegu,</hi> the King, Queen, and whole Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oblig'd to be preſent, with great Pomp and Splendour. The ſecond is obſerv'd in the City of <hi>Pegu,</hi> where the chief Men erect Pillars and Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids of different Faſhions, round which in the Night they hang light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Torches and Wax Candles, and the like, to enlighten thoſe that come to Worſhip the great Idol. The Third is kept in Honour of a particular Idol,

before which the King, Queen, and their Children, preſent themſelves in Triumphal Chariots. The Fourth is the Feaſt of Water, the King, Nobles, and all the People ſporting themſelves by throwing Water one upon another; and 'tis impoſſible to paſs the Streets without being ſoundly wet. Laſtly, the Fifth is celebrated only at <hi>Macao,</hi> but the King and whole Court are always there; and their greateſt Recreation and Entertainment is to ſee the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans in their Barks upon the Water; the Prize of the firſt being a Statue of Gold; to the ſecond, one of Silver; and all the reſt are expos'd to the Deriſion of the Spectators.</p>
                           <p>The King of <hi>Pegu</hi> has been reckon'd by ſome Authors, next to the <hi>Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul,</hi>

                     <p>IN <hi>India</hi> the <hi>Silk-Worms</hi> in <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> are in Eggs 12 Days. Or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Natives Account, one <hi>Aggoa,</hi> from which the Silk then made, is called <hi>Aggoued-bund,</hi> and is the beſt that is made all the Year. After twelve Days from the firſt of <hi>November,</hi> the Worms are hatch'd, or come out of their Eggs, and are laid upon Matts.</p>
                     <p>The four firſt Days after they are laid upon Matts, they give them Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry Leaves, cut into ſmall thin pieces, to feed upon Four times a Day, <hi>viz.</hi> Morning, Noon, and at 3 and 9 a Clock.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="600" facs="tcp:43688:317"/>The 5th Day they muſt not be fed at all.</p>
                     <p>The 6th day the Worms will be ſomewhat bigger, and muſt be fed with big pieces of Leaves, and that four times a Day, according to the times before mention'd.</p>
                     <p>The 7th, 8th, 9th, feed them as on the 6th day.</p>
                     <p>The 10th Day they muſt not be fed at all.</p>
                     <p>The 11th Day they muſt be fed with larger pieces of Leaves, and four times a day, as formerly.</p>
                     <p>The 12th day they are to be fed with whole Leaves, and four times a Day.</p>
                     <p>The 13th and 14th they muſt not be fed at all.</p>
                     <p>The 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, they muſt be fed with whole Leaves, and four times a day.</p>
                     <p>The 19th Day, feed them five times, <hi>viz.</hi> Morning, Noon, at 3, and 9 a Clock, and at Mid-night, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to feed them ſo to the 26th in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="601" facs="tcp:43688:317"/>The Worms from about the 14th day, will begin to be green, and at the 26th day will be about 2¼ Inches long.</p>
                     <p>The 17th day they will be of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour like Yellow and White, and then you muſt not feed them any more, becauſe they begin to ſpin.</p>
                     <p>The 28th day, they muſt be put upon Ledges of Matt, faſten'd to a large piece of round Matting, the Led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges being about an Inch high from the Mat, and running round like a Screw, beginning at the Center of the Mat, and running round at about a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or three Inches diſtance to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. When the Worms are put upon thoſe Ledges, they ſet the Mats leaning in the Sun, about 8 in the Morning, and let them ſtand for 1½ Hour; then they put them into the Houſe or Shade, leaning againſt the Wall; after, at 4 a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, they put them again into the Sun, and let them ſtand 'till Sun-Set; then they put them in the Houſe or Shade, leaning againſt a Wall, and in this Day and Night's time, they will have made their Houſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="602" facs="tcp:43688:318"/>The 29th Day they take the Worms with their new Silk Houſes, and put them upon other Mats, flat, without any Ledges or Partitions, and ſo lay ſeveral Mats upon Frames one over another.</p>
                     <p>The 30, 31, 32, and 33 days, they ſpin within their Houſes of Silk, and then they take each Worm with its Houſe, and ſhake it at their Ears, and thoſe that are alive, they are good, and fit for Breeders, which are kept for ſuch, and thoſe that make no noiſe are dead, having ſpun away their Life. Sometimes ⅛ ¼ 1/16 live; ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs; for great Heats and Colds kill many.</p>
                     <p>The 34, 35, 36, 37th days, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſpinning.</p>
                     <p>The 38th day the Worms eat thro' their Houſes, and are like a Butterfly; after which they take up their Houſes, and put the Worms upon new Mats; the Males they know by their ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Females by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which, being plac'd near each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, join; but if there be more of one ſort than the other, then after they have done with the leſſer number, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Males or Females, they join them with the reſt, and let them lie all Night.</p>
                     <p>The 39th day they throw away the Males.</p>
                     <p>The 40th the Females lay their Eggs, after which they throw them away likewiſe. So that the whole Life of theſe Worms, is but 12 days in the Egg, and 40 days out of it; in all 52 Days.</p>
                     <p>The next Silk is made in <hi>January;</hi> and then the Worms are fourteen days in the Egg, and 40 afterwards before they die. This Silk is called <hi>Maug-Bund,</hi> and is the Sixth, and worſt ſort of Silk. The making of it ends about <hi>February</hi> the 14th.</p>
                     <p>The next is made from <hi>February</hi> the 14th to the 24th of <hi>March,</hi> and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cheita-bund.</hi> The Worms ſtay in the Eggs 8 days, and live 32 days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This is eſteem'd the ſecond ſort for goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>The next is <hi>Sauk-Bund,</hi> eſteem'd the fifth ſort for Goodneſs. The Worms ſtay in their Eggs 8 days, and live 32 days after. The making of this Silk ends about the 6th of <hi>May.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The next is <hi>Sowaud-Bund,</hi> and is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd the third ſort. The making of this alſo ends about the laſt of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September</hi> no Silk is made, and but very little in <hi>October.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the Nature of the <hi>Silk-worms</hi> in the <hi>Indies</hi> where the Heat of the Sun renders them much more fruitful than with us; for in <hi>India</hi> the Worms breed and ſpin their Silk ſix times in the Year, and in <hi>England</hi> only once, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here they remain in the Egg from the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 'till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the latter end of <hi>May.</hi> There likewiſe they are ſooner brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and begin to work ſooner, <hi>viz.</hi> 28 days after they are hatcht, but in <hi>England</hi> not 'till the 40th. Where alſo they are by a third part more tedious in breaking out of their Houſes, from the firſt day of their Spinning, than they are in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> which is there done in ten days, but here only in fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.</p>

                        <pb n="605" facs="tcp:43688:320"/>The Silk-worm derives its Birth from the Seed of the Butterfly, which is as ſmall as the Heads of Pins, and does ſomewhat reſemble Rape-Seed, being flatted on both ſides. This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect, by whoſe Induſtry we have the Silk, which is ſpun out of its Bowels, and artificially form'd by its Mouth into the Faſhion of a Clew, differs not very much from a Caterpillar, either in the Shape or Bulk, baiting that this is more Hairy, and its Web is weaker, and of another Colour. And yet for want of Mulberry-Leaves (which is the moſt proper Food for the Silk-Worm) when they are forc'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by the Leaves of the Roſe-Buſh, Lettice, or ſome others (which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are made uſe of) this Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either weakens the Thread they Spin, and makes it as uſeleſs as that of the Caterpillars, or elſe they will not work at all. But that which ſeems moſt remarkable and wonderful in this Animal, is its change of ſhape, and one would think of Species, in the transformation of it from a Reptile to a Volatile, from a creeping Worm into a Butterfly. The Grain or Seed
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:43688:321"/>
of theſe Creatures was tranſported in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> above three hundred Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, by two Religious Perſons, but their Silk was of a longer Date, and brought above a Thouſand Years ſince among the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it in Latin, <hi>Sericum,</hi> from an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riental People, called <hi>Seres,</hi> who were very induſtrious and careful in its Improvement.</p>
